== What We Had ==

* A Wiki.
* Maintenance nightmare.
* Annoyed users.

== What We Wanted ==

* Plain text format in version control.
* Real working code behind code snippets.
* Even have _tests_ for that code!

== Building Blocks ==

* AsciiDoc format.
* Static and generated content.
* Different approaches to integrate with code/tests.

== The Flow of Content ==

* Content is currently per module (which might change).
* Static in `src/docs/`, generated in `target/docs/`.
* Ends up in `*-docs.jar` artifact.
* Assembled to produce the manual.

== Embedded ==

* Working code.
* With tests.
* Code brought into the docs via snippet extension.

== REST API ==

* Based on functional testing.
* Captures request and response.
* Text can be in JavaDoc -- don't autoformat it though!

== Cypher ==

* Lives in a separate module.
* The detail-level text lives inside the tests.
* The body text lives in `*.asciidoc` files.

== GraphGist ==

* A _format_ -- extending AsciiDoc -- with two implementations.
** The online tool at http://gist.neo4j.org/.
** A Java implementation with simple assertions; used for the manual.
* Focus on the Cypher language or on a domain.

== Output Formats ==

* HTML for web.
* Increased focus on interactivity.
** Live console for single queries.
** GraphGist-like pages for tutorials/sections.
* PDF still needed.

== Workflow ==

* Pair with documentation team (me!) to ensure a smooth process and high quality.
* Keep implementation and documentation close in time.
* Actually run the documentation toolchain and check the output.
** `mvn install -DdocsBuild` gives a preview of the manual.
** `mvn install -DdocsBuild -DfullManualBuild` produces the real manual, including performing some extra validation (for example referential integrity of cross-references).

== Writing ==

* Put one sentence per line.
* Read up on the AsciiDoc format.
* Docs for docs: http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/snapshot/community-docs.html

== Current Strengths And Weaknesses ==

* Good detail-level documentation.
* Cool generated graph visualizations and interactivity!
* Test coverage -- I think we should aim for 100% here.
  Bugs in examples are almost always related to insufficient testing.
* Missing pieces when it comes to tie things together.
* Lack in seeing how a change affects different areas, for example upgrades or things only mentioned in text, not in example code.
* Native dependencies in the documentation toolchain.

== Cypher Refcard ==

* A separate project, see http://docs.neo4j.org/refcard/2.0/
* Backed by tests in Scala.
* Currently synced with Cypher per milestone release.
